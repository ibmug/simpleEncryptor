# Simple Encryptor

Encryptor done with Javascript.

## Installation

Just go to the index page and follow the instructions, very simple.


## Thoughts on the Project

Came across multiple ways that one can encrypt as well as randomize.
Didn't think the subject was that important as it could play huge roles in security as well as statistics.
